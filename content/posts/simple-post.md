This is a simple blog post written in plain markdown. No complicated setup needed!

Just write your content in markdown files in the `content/posts` directory and they'll automatically appear on your blog.

## Why This Works

1. **Simple file structure** - Just markdown files in a folder
2. **Automatic parsing** - Frontmatter is extracted for metadata
3. **Full markdown support** - All standard markdown features work
4. **SEO friendly** - Meta tags are automatically generated
